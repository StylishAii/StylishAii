👋hello, My name is @StylishAii.
👀I am an AI developer and a Japanese who has lived abroad.
I have been interested in programming for a very long time and have been working in this field for a long time.
I have majored in many web and mobile app development programming languages, but it didn't attract my interest and I couldn't pursue my passion. 
Now I am enjoying and rewarding my life with AI development and I am thinking this is my path and my life.
🌱 I learn programming languages very quickly, but I am not good at learning natural languages. 
    I am good at English, but I have difficulty with Japanese because I am not familiar with it. 
    I am currently studying Japanese.
💞️ I accept proposals for participation in open source projects, as well as willing to accept job offers.
📫 You can contact me by e-mail: hira.r.0330@gmail.com.

⚡ I love cartoon movies like a kid.
