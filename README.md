👋 Hi, I’m @HiraRyoko, My real name is Hira Ryoko. I'm from japan.
👀 I have been interested in programming for a very long time. I had to write in many programming languages, but now I settled on the GoLang.
🌱 I am very good and fast at learning programming languages, but I am very bad at learning natural languages. Now I'm trying to learn English, but I still don't know English very well.
💞️ I accept proposals for participation in open source projects, as well as willing to accept job offers.
📫 You can contact me by e-mail: hira.r.0330@gmail.com.
📫 My telegram ID is @jamarius_a .
⚡ I love cartoon movies like a kid.
